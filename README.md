This project is a sophisticated Natural Language Processing (NLP) API that provides text summarisation and sentiment analysis functionalities. The backend is built using FastAPI, a modern web framework for building APIs with Python, while the front end is developed using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The core functionality relies on pre-trained models from Hugging Face's Transformers library, which offers state-of-the-art NLP capabilities. 
This project is designed for developers who need efficient and accurate NLP functionalities in their applications.
